Installation
------------

This package is part of the ``bda.plone.shop`` stack. Please refer to
``https://github.com/bluedynamics/bda.plone.shop`` for installation
instructions.


Integration notes
-----------------

- The order actions are done with background images in CSS, so if you have your
  own theme that is not based on Sunburst, you will have to add the "icons.on"
  part of Sunburst's base.css.


Restrictions with souper.plone
------------------------------

- Make sure you do not move orders or bookings soup away from portal root. This
  will end up in unexpected behavior and errors.


Create translations
-------------------

::

    $ cd src/bda/plone/orders/
    $ ./i18n.sh


TODO
----

- Consider vendor UID's and booking based state in mail notification

- [OK] Store order state on each booking to make it possible each vendor can handle
  state of bookings in order belonging to him

- [OK] Adopt order transitions affecting only bookings belonging to vendor
  triggering the change

- [OK] Extend plone.app.workflow to throw a LocalrolesModifiedEvent

- [OK] Add customer_role index storing all usernames which have customer role on
  several areas of the portal

- add is_customer utility

- improve customers vocabulary utility to be more cpu friendly

- search text in orders view needs to consider vendor and customer filter

- [OK] ajaxify orders table if filters get changed

- Display Export orders link only for vendors and administrators



TODO Future
-----------

- Move IUUID adapter for IPloneSiteRoot to bda.plone.cart, which is the central
  package for the shop.

- cart_discount_net and cart_discount_vat values calculation for vendor specific
  orders in order view and order export.

- skip payment for individual bookings instead of whole order, if they are in
  state reserved.

- warning-popup, if state is changed globally for all bookings in @@orders view

- buyable_uid, buyable_count, buyable_comment -> should be named cartitem_*?

- customer role -> move to bda.plone.cart

- eventually create common.BookingTransitions and common.BookingData

- fix dependency in bda.plone.payment.cash.__init__, which depends on b.p.orders

- eventually create: or bda.shop, which defines the interfaces. every other
  package can depend on, which eases the dependency chain
